# Resnext

## Introduction

The architecture Resnext is one of phenomenal architectures with a very good performance in terms of accuracy and computational complexity. This architecture merged the concept of branching-off convolution from the Inception model and residual network together. In other words, we can think Inception + Resnet = ResNext!
The paper is referred in [1] which was first proposed in 2016.

## Contributions

- Significant improvement to the performance on the Classification and Object detection tasks compared to Resnet.
- Significant improvement to the computational complexity.

### Inception vs Resnext

The famous paper of Googlenet introduced the concept of breaking the Convolutional layers into several different groups.
[add inception naive picture] . The Resnext paper added residual to connection from the previous layer to the next layer after the splitting of the convolutions.
